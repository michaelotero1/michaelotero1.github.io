 Don't know if you've noticed but nowadays whenever you ever try to book an appointment or make a reservation you use an app or website to do that.  So I've always thought to myself, "why not create my own". Having been in the customer service industry for a few years now, I have noticed a lot of things that we could do differently. Things are always better off automated to make it easier for the customers and the employees. Having had my experiences and failures, i know i have a lot to bring to the table. I am also a strong believer in working hard and in starting to make my dreams flourish. Now being in Flat Iron I have learned that they can help me succeed.
